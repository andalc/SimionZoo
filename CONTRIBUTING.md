#### **I want to report a bug**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/simionsoft/SimionZoo/issues).

Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **I fixed a bug**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please run all tests and build all the configurations.

#### **I made some little aesthetic changes in the code?**

* Please wait before you open a pull request until you have some substantial contribution.

#### **I want to add a new feature**

* Suggest your change in [Issues](https://github.com/simionsoft/SimionZoo/issues) and tag the new Issue with label _enhancement_.

* We suggest you do not start working on the feature until you have collected positive feedback about the change.
